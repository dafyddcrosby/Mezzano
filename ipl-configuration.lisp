;; The *file-server-â€¦-directory* variables contains path in the file
;; server host. the HOST component of those paths will be replaced by
;; "REMOTE" in the IPL to access the file server remotely.  This
;; allows this configuration to be used by install-dependencies.lisp

;; Note: we cannot use pathname functions at run-time because the
;; pathname subsystem is not initialized yet.  So we must use #. to
;; compute the string in the host environment.
